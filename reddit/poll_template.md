**PLEASE read all of the following!**

To vote, comment "I" (just "I", nothing else) on the nomination 
comments below that you choose. Nomination comments will be 
marked with a "(Nomin)". You have <insert votes> votes that you 
may use; you may use all of them on one nomination, or 
distribute them however you want between multiple nominations. 
If any person votes more than <insert votes> times, all of his/
her votes will be **ignored**.

Please read through **all** the nominations before you vote!

**Do NOT create your own nominations!** This is a poll, not a 
time for nominations! Any unapproved nominations will be dealt 
with *swiftly* and *effectively*.

Please also do not comment in any way other than voting. This 
is not the place for chitchat.
