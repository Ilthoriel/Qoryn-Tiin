<insert announcement>

Your nomination may need to reference the history or other 
aspects of Qoryn Tiin. But please keep it as simple as 
possible, so as to allow those aspects to be primarily decided 
at another time.

Before you submit a nomination, please read our rules about 
nominations and our 
[guidelines](https://www.reddit.com/r/QorynTiin/comments/fkvff2/nomination_and_polling_specifics/).
To submit a nomination, simply reply to this post with a 
comment containing your world structure idea that begins with 
`(Nomin)`. Make sure your underlying idea hasn't already been 
said by someone else.

If you haven't already, please head to our
[Discord server](https://discord.gg/VxdUDEQ)!

The deadline for nominations is `<insert datetime>`. After that 
time, we will take the 5 most upvoted nominations and vote on 
them with a poll in a separate post.
