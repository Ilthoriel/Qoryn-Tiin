# The Haven Parasite

## History

>A plague known as the “Haven” parasite dates back to even around the first recordings of history.

In the past, the Haven parasite broke out many times. However,

>slowly over time and with more centralization due to advancement in technology the parasite disappeared and was declared to be eradicated.

This parasite was created by a figure from the past:

>a Qoryntinian created this with the intent to eliminate his enemies but also killed him too

However, this is unknown to most in Qoryn Tiin, as it is said that

>[the Haven parasite] was a plague of unknown origin

## Symptoms

The Haven parasite had several identifying symptoms, most notably that it

>infected hosts and drained their bodies of magical energy.

The parasite also affected the minds of its victims:

>They would lose conscious thought and would be at the whims of the parasite.

Visible symptoms were also included:

>The hosts then would start to be unrecognizable as their lack of magical energy from the greedy parasite contorted their own bodies to somehow still live

>Makes the hosts also glow.

while

>the bone structure, organs, and tissue change to suit the parasites’ will

## Reproduction

>After attaching to the host it would begin draining energy for its survival and replicates itself killing the host and the next parasite continues on

After some spreading and basic reproduction, it

>create[s] a new organ to make more parasites, making a strange growth on the body

It adapts and optimizes itself to save host's body:

>The parasites become more energy efficient so the Haven organ is less taxing on the infected host letting it live longer


>It begins to use and understand magic to create defenses from healthy hosts killing infected hosts

However,

>often infected hosts would implode in gory, luminescent, magic, [which] actually was used to advantage as [a] viable infective method

## Host Integration

As mentioned before,

>When it attaches to the brain stem the host begins to lose conscious thought, no longer able to think for themselves

The parasite controls its victims by

>releas[ing] its own signals and hormones alike [to] the brain to use motor control

Unfortunately,

>the host would die due to certain organs not receiving the right signals from the brain

Following "death",

>the parasite begins to understand bodily function and makes less careless mistakes so the host can live. [It] begins to use signals and create stronger muscle tissue through its own stimulus, it also creates bigger and better organs through said stimulus. The host anatomy becomes unrecognizable as the bone structure, organs, and tissue change to suit the parasites’ will.

## Appearance

>The parasite glows, very very small, and actually looks cute, often first mistaken as harmless.

>They also can shape shift to not look like the Haven parasite. Like a bag of tea.

## Immunity

>Dragons are immune but the Havins have evolved over time to be able to combat them.

It has not been specified whether other races can be/are immunized.

# The Denis Elliot Device

>Sometimes in certain areas this parasite would appear. They were known as the “Haven Outbreaks”. But slowly over time and with more centralization due to advancement in technology the parasite disappeared and was declared to be eradicated.

>But the parasite was weak and by anyone who can fight an infected host without the parasites attaching to a new healthy host it could be eliminated as the parasite(s) are starved out.

Current technology and the world conflict had other plans in store, though.

>The Greater War several years in proves to be a brutal conflict. No quarter, no mercy. In a desperate attempt to quickly end the war an empire develops a magical/biological weapon. The Denis Elliot Device or DED for short made by one of the greatest scientists led by moral belief that this evil is for the greater good.

>It contains a parasite that was thought to be eradicated long ago and for good reason. The properties of it still had magic that was unexplained by science.

>Denis Elliot made the parasite more dangerous so it can be quick and swift. So much so that the parasite would accidently kill itself after just a few hours and it also had a quick breeding rate so it could spread fast. He chose this disease for its infectivity and deadliness. However this genetically engineered and unknowingly magically engineered plague would prove its unpredictability.

## Purpose

>The DED would be used against military installations and even on the front lines. After it was used the troops can move in after the Haven took its effect. But the empire’s military quickly changed their targets to civilians to diminish the enemy's spirit, morale, and productivity. And too a certain extent proved to be working and the empire made quick advances across territories.

## Effect

>Now the world is on the verge of collapse. Current surviving governments now put up a resistance against Haven on an allied front. It finally turned into a stalemate as the Qoryntinians fought against the evolution curve of Haven. It even starts to build a bigger [consciousness] of greater intelligence and survives indefinitely. So much so the infected hosts are called "Havins". To the current day the amount of mutations are almost lost track of and every foe a Qoryntinian face is an unpredictable one.
